## Description

Our voice recognition application applys MFCC feature extractor to extract features from the audio file, then comapres it with the recorded data feature to recognize the speaker.
- we used SVM classifier, in this model, the data is mapped in a hyperplan in multidimensional feature space so the points can be categorized, even if its not linearly separable.
- Note that: it could have better preformance & accuracy if we used deep learning neural networks, but we was asked to not use deep learning in our project.


**This app allows user to recognize:**
- which person is talking (fingerprints).
- whether the user is from a certain group of people or not.
- Whether the password is correct or wrong. 

## Overview about the usage method:
- the user clicks on the microphone icon, records an audio, and the reuslts apper;
- then the app goes through 3 stages;
- in the first one, it recognizes the password.
- then, it recognizes whether the person is a member of the group or not.
- the last one, if the member is confirmed to be a member of the group, it recognizes which member he is.
- so; if the password is incorrect, the access is denied whether the person is from the group or not.
- if the user is a member of the group, and the password is wrong,  the access is also denied.

- #### About the graphs

- the lower left graph plots the recorded audio point to see whether it's closer to inGroup or Out of the group data
- the lower right one is a graph of a dominant feature in the audio files, if the speaker is a member of the group, it lights his curve. 
- the upper right graph plots 8 dominant features in the audio records of the group members to compare between them.
